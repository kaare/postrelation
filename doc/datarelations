ORM
--
Basic needs
- Being able to write random sql. Sql is powerful.
- Something that understands database schemas.
- Something that will make acessors for columns.
- Something that will optionally inflate/deflate columns.
- Something that will make an iterator over rows.
- Per web request data caching.
- Something that can detect metadata changes and automatically apply the correct DDL (data tables only).
  See more in doc/datasyncing
- Proper transaction handling.
- Don't reinvent sql features.

ORLite seems to be something like what I want. Unfortunately only for SQLite. Perhaps there's
something to be pillaged.
